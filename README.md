Hi there,

I'm a Business management graduate, with special interests and strenghts in Statistics and Finance. 
Iâ€™m currently studying different coding languages in order to feed my analytical needs.  I mostly use Excel, SQL and pandas for it. 

- My github page is a composite of different projects i've been doing to improve and practise the aforessaid tools. 
- I'm open to work in any kind of project in need of Webscraping, Data Cleaning, Visualization or any kind of Data exploration.
